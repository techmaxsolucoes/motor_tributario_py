GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to ensure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

An additional permission is needed in the case of network server
software to ensure that users interacting with the software remotely
have the opportunity to receive the source code of the version that
they are using.

This is the Affero version of the GPL, intended to ensure that the
source code of modified versions of such network server software is
made available to the users of the server.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

"Combined Work" means a work produced by combining or linking a covered
work with another work that is not covered by this License.

"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are
not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes
interface definition files associated with source files for the work,
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms
and other parts of the work.

The "Corresponding Source" need not include anything that users can
recreate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

"User Product" means either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
personal use or household item which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
modified Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no
worse a relationship to the user than the unmodified object code was
in relation to the user before modification.

1. Source Code.

The "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a
work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
